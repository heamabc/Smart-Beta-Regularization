# Smart-Beta-with-Regularization
In this project, I will first test the performance of smart beta strategy. Then implement regularization technique to different smart beta srategies.

## Smart Beta Strategies
- Maximum Diversification Ratio
- Maximum Sharpe Ratio
- Global Minimum Variance

## Regularization
As there will not be any sparse weight for stocks. I only implement L2 regularization.
